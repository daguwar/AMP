# AMP Programs and Scripts

This repository is to track programs and scripts that I am writing for interaction with the Cisco AMP for Endpoints suite of products and integrations.  These are in no way supported by Cisco, but are merely a product of my desire to automate some tasks.  Feel free to fork any of these for your own use.
